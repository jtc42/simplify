# simplify

A Chrome extension that brings the simplicity of Google Inbox to Gmail, Calendar and Keep


## Who made Simplify
Simplify was made by [Michael Leggett](https://leggett.org).


## Is Simplify safe?
You should always be super careful what extensions or apps you use, especially with your email. Simplify is mostly some CSS plus a little Javascript to apply the CSS. There are no trackers. No data is sent or shared. And no ads ever. Promise. All of the code can be inspected here on Github.
